	<p>
	WHAT was the use of  
	<br><br><br>
	not leaving
	<br><br>
	it there where it
	<br><br><br>
	would hang
	<br><br><br><br>
	what was the use if 
	<br>there was no chance of 
	<br><br>
	ever
	<br>
	seeing
	<Br>
	it
	come there
	<br><br>
	and show that it was 
	<br>
	handsome and
	<br>
	right in the 
	<br>
	way
	<br><br>
	it
	<br><br>
	showed
	<br><br>
	it.
	<br><br><br>
	The lesson is to learn that it does show it, 
	<br>
	that it shows it and 
	<br>
	that nothing, 
	<br>
	that there is nothing, 
	<br>that there is 
	<br>no more 
	<br><br>
	to
	<br><br>
	do about it and just 
	<br><br>
	so much more 
	<br>
	is there plenty of reason for making an exchange.
