	<p>
	WHAT was the use of not leaving 
	<br><br>
	it there
	<br><br>
	where it
	<br><br> 
	would hang
	<br><br><br>
	what was the use if there was
	<br><br>
	no chance
	<br><br>
	of ever
	<br><br>
	seeing it
	<br><br>
	come
	<br><br>
	there
	<br><br>
	and show that it was handsome and
	<br><br>
	right in
	<br><br>
	the way
	<br><br>
	it
	<br><br>
	showed
	<br><br>
	it.
	<br><br><br>
	The lesson is to learn
	<br>
	that it does show it, 
	<br>
	that it shows it and 
	<br>
	that nothing, 
	<br>
	that 
	<br>there is nothing, 
	<br>that there is no more 
	<br><br>
	to 
	<br><br>
	do about it and 
	<br><br>
	just so much more 
	<br>is there plenty of reason for making an exchange.
